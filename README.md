When working in a text-based shell, you have a variety of options for managing processes and tasks. In this course, Scott Simpson highlights ways to manage processes and use terminal multiplexers to improve your productivity.


 
Learn how to send processes to the background and retrieve them. Go over how to explore terminal multiplexers, which allow you to use one terminal window for many sessions at once. Discover how these tools can integrate with your regular workflow and how they can improve the reliability and safety of your processes.
